# Diagram-PxV-Clayperon-
This project contains the source code for creating a Pv diagram. The model used deals with the compression/expansion of an ideal gas against an external pressure in a reversible process at constant temperature. Some concepts and tools used are:

*Creation of functions (for example, the equation of state of ideal gases, $P(V)=nRT$);
*List comprehension;
*Use of the scipy library to calculate the value of the integral $W=-\int P(V)dV$; and the matplotlib library for graph construction.
